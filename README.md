# 🙌 Introduction to Programming Second Workshop
A repo that contains details about the second workshop that I have joined as a technical trainer at Istanbul University-Cerrahpaşa

> Workshop Date: 14.05.2019 📅

## 📃 Summary
As Computer Club at Istanbul University (İÜBK), we did the second workshop in the context of "Introduction to Programming" course on 14.05.2019. I joined the workshop as a trainer, our target was developing problem solving skill, we tried to do that by doing code exercises using "Object Oriented Programming" concepts.
My participation in this workshop gave me a good experience in technical content preparation and explanation and developed my presentation skills.

## ⁉ What have we done?
We have added new features to **"Game of Life"** then we wrote its C++ code together in the workshop. 

Technically, to be able to code the game we have used object oriented programming concepts :sparkles:, such as _classes_, _class members_. In the other hand we have used _dynamic matrices_ and then _file operations_ to save the generations. 

## 🔎 Why Game of Life?
Well, our target was _developing problem solving skill_ and to be able to do that we had to select a problem that requires thinking and at the same time it must be funny to be more effective 😅 so that we chose _Game of Life_ but because that it is not complicated as we want we added **Zombie** parameter to make it more complicated 🤪😵
